# ECSE429 - Software Validation Project
Group 29 : Rania Ouassif 

The application under test is a “rest api todo list manager” which may be run as a local host.

## Project Part A : Exploratory Testing of Rest API
- Charter Driven Session Based Exploratory Testing
- The charter is:
    
    - Identify capabilities and areas of potential instability of the “rest api todo list manager”.
    - Identify documented and undocumented “rest api todo list manager” capabilities.
    - For each capability create a script or small program to demonstrate the capability.
    - Exercise each capability identified with data typical to the intended use of the application.
- Unit Test Suite
- Report
## Project Part B: Story Testing of Rest API
- Story Test Suite
  - Normal flow
  - Alternate flow 
  - Error flow
- Story Test Automation
  - Cucumber.io
- Report
## Project Part C: Non-Functional Testing of Rest API
- Performance Testing
    - Dynamic Analysis : As the number of objects increase measure the time required to add, delete, or change the objects.
    - Static Analysis  : the Rest API to do list manager will be studied with the community edition of the Sonar Cube static analysis tool.
        - code complexity, 
        - code statement counts, 
        - any technical risks, technical debt or code smells
